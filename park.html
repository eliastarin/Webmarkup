      <h1>Heemstede Green Spaces</h1>
      <p>
        Heemstede has a lot of urban green spaces, the most well-known being the
        biggest park in town, Buitenplaats Leyduin, which is the best choice for
        those who want to spend some time in nature and breathe non-polluted
        air. It is also very good for people with animals, as the park has many
        routes where one can walk with a dog or bike through the forest.

              Rich families once only used Buitenplaats Leyduin as a summer
              residence. Now everyone can enjoy the old forests, beautiful
              avenues, birds, exuberant bracken, and deer here all year round.
              Walking, cycling, or an excursion, it's all possible here!
