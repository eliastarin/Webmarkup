      Heemstede is a small municipality of 20,000 residents located in the
      south of Haarlem, in the North Holland Province. It is a very charming
      place, quiet and full of beautiful scenery that include old parks and
      the famous Dutch canals that run through all the neighborhoods. It is
      the perfect place for a student looking for accommodation during studies
      and a great stop for a first-timer in the Netherlands.
