        Heemstede is a small municipality of 20,000 residents located in the
        south of Haarlem, in the North Holland Province. It is a very charming
        place, quiet and full of beautiful scenery that include old parks and
        the famous Dutch canals that run through all the neighborhoods. It is
        the perfect place for a student looking for accommodation during studies
        and a great stop for a first-timer in the Netherlands.
